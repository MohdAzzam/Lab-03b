        <article> Associazione Calcio Milan (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly
            referred to as A.C. Milan or simply Milan, is a professional football club in Milan, Italy, founded in
            1899.[4][5] The club has spent its entire history, with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons, in
            the top flight of Italian football, known as Serie A since 1929–30.[4]
            <br>
            A.C. Milan's 18 FIFA and UEFA trophies is the fourth highest out of any club (joint with Boca Juniors), and
            the most out of any Italian club.[6][7][8][9] Milan has won a joint record three Intercontinental Cups and
            one FIFA Club World Cup,[9] seven European Cup/Champions League titles (Italian record),[9] the UEFA Super
            Cup a joint record five times and the Cup Winners' Cup twice.[9] With 18 league titles, Milan is also the
            joint-second most successful club in Serie A, along with local rivals Internazionale and behind Juventus (36
            league titles).[10] They have also won the Coppa Italia five times, and the Supercoppa Italiana seven.[9]
            <br>
            Milan's home games are played at San Siro, also known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The stadium, which is
            shared with city rivals Internazionale, is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of
            75,923.[11] They have a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina;
            it is one of the most followed derbies in football.[12]
            <br>
            The club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world football.[13] It was a founding member of the
            now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club
            Association.[14] </article>
